1. Use Picasso for displaying image from a URL or Uri into ImageView
    http://square.github.io/picasso/
2. Circle image view for navigation drawer
    https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView
3. In case of multiple fragments, the main drawer activity should implement OnFragmentInteractionListener of all the fragments,
   as shown below:

    public class DashboardActivity extends AppCompatActivity
        implements NavigationView.OnNavigationItemSelectedListener,
        DashHomeFragment.OnFragmentInteractionListener,
        DashProfileFragment.OnFragmentInteractionListener {..}
4. GitHub
    root folder of project has the .git folder. In that, open the config file to find properties and change appropriately
